1. Start RStudio.
2. Under the File menu, click on New Project. Choose New Directory, then New Project.
3. Enter a name for this new folder (or “directory”), and choose a convenient location for it. This will be your **working directory** for the rest of the day (e.g., ~/data-carpentry).
4. Click on Create Project.
5. Create new folder “data” 


## Creating objects 



*   Known as variables in other programming languages 
*   Simple math 
    *   **<code>> 3+5</code></strong> 
    *   <strong><code>[1] 8 </code></strong>
*   Assigning values to objects 
    *   <strong><code>&lt;-</code></strong>
    *   <strong><code>X &lt;- 3 </code></strong>
    *   <strong><code>weight_kg &lt;- 55</code></strong>
    *   Some restrictions on naming objects e.g. cannot start with numbers, best to avoid “.” 
    *   When setting an object it will appear in the environment panel ( top right) 
*   Can reassign values 


### Challenge 1

What will be the variable after each statement? 

> mass &lt;- 47.5

> age &lt;- 122

> mass &lt;- mass * 2.3

> age &lt;- age - 20


## Comments



*   Anything to the right of #
    *   # this is a comment 
*   Ctrl + Shift + C


## Functions 



*   > round(3.14159)
*   > round(3.14159, 2) 
    *   2 is how many digits 
    *   [1] 3.14
*   > args(round)
    *   What type of input(arguments) it takes 
*   > ?round 
    *   Get help


## Vectors and data types 



*   a set of values in a certain order of the same data type
*   we can create a vector of animal weights and assign it to a new object
    *   > weight_g &lt;- **c**(50, 60, 65, 82)
    *   > weight_g
*   Create a vector of a list of animals 
    *   > animals &lt;- **c**("mouse", "rat", "dog")
    *   > animals 
    *   “” are important. If they aren’t there then R will assume this objects have already been created 
*   > class(animals) # check the data type of the objects  
*   Adding to your vector 
    *   > weight_g &lt;- c(weight_g, 90) 
    *   > weight_g
*   6 types of atomic vectors 
    *   "logical" for TRUE and FALSE (the boolean data type)
    *   "integer" for integer numbers (e.g., 2L, the L indicates to R that it’s an integer)
    *   "complex" to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., 1 + 4i) and that’s all we’re going to say about them
    *   "raw" for bitstreams
    *   “Character”
    *   “Numeric” 
    *   typeof()


### Challenge 2 

What happens in each of these examples? (use class() to check data type of to the objects) 

> num_char &lt;- **c**(1, 2, 3, "a")

> char_logical &lt;- **c**("a", "b", "c", TRUE)


## Subsetting vectors 

> animals &lt;- c(“mouse”, “rat”, “dog”, “cat”)

> animals [2] 

> more_animals &lt;- animals(c[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]  # creating a vector with more elements than the original one 

> more_animals 


## Missing data



*   NA if the data is missing a value 
*   > heights &lt;- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
*   > heights 
*   > mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)   # na.rm allows the result to be calculated while ignoring the missing data 
*   is.na() ,  na.omit() ,  complete.cases()  # useful functions when working with missing data 


### Challenge 3

What does each of the functions do? is.na()   na.omit()  and complete.cases()

>  heights &lt;- **c**(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)

> heights[! is.na(heights)] 

> na.omit(heights)

> heights[complete.cases(heights) ] 


## Starting with Data 

**<code>> </code>download.file</strong>(url="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",

          	destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")           # destfile is the file you are saving it to and the file will be named portal_data_joined.csv 

> surveys &lt;- **read.csv**("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")   # will not see any output but should see it appear in the environment panel 

> **head**(surveys)   # will show the first 6 lines of the file 

Data frames: the representation of data in the format of a table where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers, factors).



<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/W8-Ch81.png).

![alt_text](images/W8-Ch81.png "image_tooltip")


> **str**(surveys)    #allows you to investigate the structure of the data frame 



*   Size:
    *   `dim(surveys)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element, and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of the object)
    *   `nrow(surveys)` - returns the number of rows
    *   `ncol(surveys)` - returns the number of columns
*   Content:
    *   `head(surveys)` - shows the first 6 rows
    *   `tail(surveys)` - shows the last 6 rows
*   Names:
    *   `names(surveys)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame` objects)
    *   `rownames(surveys)` - returns the row names
*   Summary:
    *   `str(surveys)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column
    *   `summary(surveys)` - summary statistics for each column


### Challenge

Based on the output of **<code>str(surveys)</code></strong>, can you answer the following questions?



*   What is the class of the object `surveys`?
*   How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
*   How many species have been recorded during these surveys?


## Indexing and subsetting data frames 



*   Can extract specific data for the data frame
*   surveys[1,1]  # rows first and then columns 

# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)

> surveys[1, 1]  

# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)

> surveys[1, 6]  

# first column of the data frame (as a vector)

> surveys[, 1]	

# first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)

> surveys[1]  	

# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)

> surveys[1:3, 7]   # creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing or decreasing order

> surveys[, -1]          # The whole data frame, except the first column

> surveys["species_id"]   	# Result is a data.frame

> surveys[, "species_id"] 	# Result is a vector


### A harder challenge



1. Create a data.frame (surveys_200) containing only the data in row 200 of the surveys dataset.
2. Notice how nrow() gave you the number of rows in a data.frame? \

    *   Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
    *   Compare that with what you see as the last row using tail() to make sure it’s meeting expectations.
    *   Pull out that last row using nrow() instead of the row number.
    *   Create a new data frame (surveys_last) from that last row.
3. Use nrow() to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named surveys_middle.
4. Combine nrow() with the - notation above to reproduce the behavior of head(surveys), keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.


## Factors 



*   Represent categorical data 
*   Stored as integers associated with labels 
    *   Can look and act like character vectors but are integer vectors 
*   Pre-defined set of values known as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">levels </span>
    *   Levels are sorted alphabetically 

> sex &lt;- **factor**(**c**("male", "female", "female", "male"))

> levels(sex)   # f comes before m; 1 will be assigned to female and 2 will be assigned to male 



*   It is possible to reorder levels 

> sex   # original order 

 sex &lt;- **factor**(sex, levels = **c**("male", "female"))     # reorder to assign 1 to male and 2 to female 

> sex # after reordering 


## Converting factors 



*   Can convert a factor to a character vector 
    *   as.character(sex)
*   You may have to convert factors where the levels appear as numbers (such as concentration levels or years) to a numeric vector
*   The best way to avoid confusion or unwanted set of numbers is to convert factors to characters, and then to numbers
    *   as.numeric
    *   > year_fct &lt;- **factor**(**c**(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))
    *   >** as.numeric**(**as.character**(year_fct)) # Works
    *   >** as.numeric**(**levels**(year_fct))[year_fct]	# The recommended way
        *   We obtain all the factor levels using levels(year_fct)
        *   We convert these levels to numeric values using as.numeric(levels(year_fct))
        *   We then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of the vector year_fct inside the square brackets


## Renaming Factors 

> plot (sex)  # allows you to quickly see how many observations represented by each factor level. This will appear in the bottom right corner in plot 

# Notice there is a bar without a label 

> sex &lt;- surveys$sex   #pull out the data on sex 

**> head**(sex)          # quick look to make sure you have the correct data 

**> levels**(sex)          # to see what the levels are 

**> levels**(sex)[1] &lt;- "undetermined"   # taking the first level and naming it “undetermined”

**> levels**(sex)  # levels after renaming 

**> head**(sex)   # the file after renaming 

> **plot**(sex) # Did the new label appear? 


### Challenge



*   Rename “F” and “M” to “female” and “male” respectively.
*   Now that we have renamed the factor level to “undetermined”, can you recreate the barplot such that “undetermined” is last (after “male”)?


## Using stringsAsFactors=FALSE


### By default, when building or importing a data frame, the columns that contain characters (i.e. text) are coerced (= converted) into factors. Depending on what you want to do with the data, you may want to keep these columns as character. To do so, read.csv() and read.table() have an argument called stringsAsFactors which can be set to FALSE.


### In most cases, it is preferable to set stringsAsFactors = FALSE when importing data and to convert as a factor only the columns that require this data type.


### ## Compare the difference between our data read as `factor` vs `character`.


### > surveys &lt;- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)


### > str(surveys)


### > surveys &lt;- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


### > str(surveys)


### A tricky challenge



1. We have seen how data frames are created when using read.csv(), but they can also be created by hand with the data.frame() function. There are a few mistakes in this hand-crafted data.frame. Can you spot and fix them? Don’t hesitate to experiment! \


animal_data &lt;- **data.frame**(

          animal = **c**(dog, cat, sea cucumber, sea urchin),

          feel = **c**("furry", "squishy", "spiny"),

          weight = **c**(45, 8 1.1, 0.8)

          )



2.  Can you predict the class for each of the columns in the following example? Check your guesses using str(country_climate):
    *   Are they what you expected? Why? Why not?
    *   What would have been different if we had added stringsAsFactors = FALSE when creating the data frame?
    *   What would you need to change to ensure that each column had the accurate data type?

country_climate &lt;- **data.frame**(

       country = **c**("Canada", "Panama", "South Africa", "Australia"),

       climate = **c**("cold", "hot", "temperate", "hot/temperate"),

       temperature = **c**(10, 30, 18, "15"),

       northern_hemisphere = **c**(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, "FALSE"),

       has_kangaroo = **c**(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, 1)


           )


## Formatting Dates

Store each component of your date and time information to ensure that it is accessible for analyses. Use str() to do this:

**str**(surveys)

We are going to use the ymd() function from the package **lubridate** (which belongs to the **tidyverse**). **lubridate** gets installed as part of the **tidyverse** installation. When you load the **tidyverse** (library(tidyverse)), the core packages (the packages used in most data analyses) get loaded. **lubridate** however does not belong to the core tidyverse, so you have to load it explicitly with library(lubridate)


### Challenge

Start by loading the required package:

**library**(lubridate)

ymd() takes a vector representing year, month, and day, and converts it to a Date vector. Date is a class of data recognized by R as being a date and can be manipulated as such. The argument that the function requires is flexible, but, as a best practice, is a character vector formatted as “YYYY-MM-DD”.

Let’s create a date object and inspect the structure:

my_date &lt;- **ymd**("2015-01-01")

**str**(my_date)

Now let’s paste the year, month, and day separately - we get the same result:

_# sep indicates the character to use to separate each component_

my_date &lt;- **ymd**(**paste**("2015", "1", "1", sep = "-")) 

**str**(my_date)

Now we apply this function to the surveys dataset. Create a character vector from the year, month, and day columns of surveys using paste():

**paste**(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-")

This character vector can be used as the argument for ymd():

**ymd**(**paste**(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-"))

#> Warning: 129 failed to parse.

The resulting Date vector can be added to surveys as a new column called date:

surveys$date &lt;- **ymd**(**paste**(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-"))

#> Warning: 129 failed to parse.

**str**(surveys) _# notice the new column, with 'date' as the class_

Let’s make sure everything worked correctly. One way to inspect the new column is to use summary():

**summary**(surveys$date)

#>         Min.      1st Qu.       Median         Mean      3rd Qu. 

#> "1977-07-16" "1984-03-12" "1990-07-22" "1990-12-15" "1997-07-29" 

#>         Max.         NA's 

#> "2002-12-31"        "129"

Something went wrong: some dates have missing values. Let’s investigate where they are coming from.

We can use the functions we saw previously to deal with missing data to identify the rows in our data frame that are failing. If we combine them with what we learned about subsetting data frames earlier, we can extract the columns “year,”month“,”day" from the records that have NA in our new column date. We will also use head() so we don’t clutter the output:

missing_dates &lt;- surveys[**is.na**(surveys$date), **c**("year", "month", "day")]

**head**(missing_dates)

#>           year month day

#> 3144 2000     9  31

#> 3817 2000     4  31

#> 3818 2000     4  31

#> 3819 2000     4  31

#> 3820 2000     4  31

#> 3856 2000     9  31

Why did these dates fail to parse? If you had to use these data for your analyses, how would you deal with this situation?
